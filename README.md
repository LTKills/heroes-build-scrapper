# heroes-build-scrapper

I've played Heroes of The Storm since its alpha releases but for some reason I've always found myself
digging builds in Icy Veins instead of comming up with my own. It was all flowers when I had two
monitors, but now that I'm back to single monitor I have to keep alt + tabbing whenever I have to
get a talent. Hopefully this project will help me by going to the page and telling me which talent
I need to get without leaving the game.
