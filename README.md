heroes-build-scrapper
=====================

I've played Heroes of The Storm since its alpha releases but for some reason
I've always found myself digging builds in Icy Veins instead of comming up with
my own. It was all flowers when I had two monitors, but now that I'm back to
single monitor I have to keep alt + tabbing whenever I have to get a talent.
Hopefully this project will help me by going to the page and telling me which
talent I need to get without leaving the game.
